# Technical Issues with Network Mapping Approaches

ToC
* Time Averaging
* Linearity
* Stats on Stats

## Time Averaging

Proposal:
* Learn Dynamics from Timeseries, operate on coefficients (SINDy)

## Linearity

Proposal:
* Don't do Linear Stuff

## Stats on Stats

Proposal: 
* ROC vs Conditioning on Thresholds

## Unicorn Causality:

Proposal:
x

## N-Hit
Traditional Mapping Approaches can't handle two-hit, or more generally N-hit, circuits for a given behavior.

Proposal:
* TBD

## Behavioral Circuits

Proposal:
* Circuit modeling in $\beta$ space, then pullback.
