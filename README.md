# Universal Network Mapping

A repository to develop a more "universal" approach to (brain) network mapping.
Theory-Driven, Clinically-Biased, and Data-Congruent in Principles.

## Setup

## Installation

## Principles
* Small Data > Big Data
* Reverse Engineering
  * Concretely, this translates to prioritizing *accounting* for variability in context directly in the model, over *controlling* or *extinguishing* that variability through empirical or statistical anchoring.
